# Zero Day Attack Detection

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/galaxyh/kdd-cup-1999-data/

To run in current form: 
1. Clone the repo
2. Go to the link and click new notebook
3. upload the .ipynb notebook and run it

I'd add an easier way to run the notebook but since the dataset is hosted on kaggle it's easier to work from there in the begining stage of the project.
