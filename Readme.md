# Zero Day Attack Detection

## This repo is a work in progress and daily updates are being made to the entire codebase; documentation research objectives, and entire paper coming soon. 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/galaxyh/kdd-cup-1999-data/
Pretrained models: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashimdahal/cil-pretrained-models-zero-day-ids


To run in current form: 
1. Clone the repo
2. Go to the link and click new notebook
3. Add the pretrained models if you are going to upload the testing notebooks
4. upload the .ipynb notebook and run it


I'd add an easier way to run the notebook but since the dataset is hosted on kaggle it's easier to work from there in the begining stage of the project.
